# [Essential Performance Metrics for Top-Tier Mobile Development](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7169829824616611840/)

𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞: Aim for a loading time of under 5 seconds from clicking the app icon 
to reaching the lobby screen. Royale Match has got it!

𝐅𝐏𝐒 (𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐏𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝): Target a consistent FPS of at least 30 ( Android 5.1 - Android 9, <iOS 15, or <iPhone 8), 
ideally aiming for 60 FPS for smooth gameplay for all iPhone 8 and higher. 60 target FPS for at least 75% of Android 10 and higher game sessions, including 95% of game sessions for high-end Android mobile devices from reputable manufacturers like Samsung or Google Pixel phones.

𝐑𝐀𝐌 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐔𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐞: Aim to keep the peak memory usage of your game under 500MB for the lobby. 
And under 975 Mb for gameplay. It will allow you to reduce significant OOM crashes and memory warnings for your app from OS. As a result, a game session will be more extended.

𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐤 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐎𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Keep the initial installed size of your game under 300MB. 
Total size with game data and cache < 1 GB. For instance, about ~9% of active Android devices with <2 GB free. You get a lower uninstall rate.

𝐃𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐒𝐢𝐳𝐞: Aim for a total app downloadable size of under 200MB. 
For iOS from IOS 13, the player can override a feature by Asking if it is over 200 Mb for a cellular network. For Google, the max APK upload size is 150 Mb, and the max download size of app variation from the app bundle for Google is 200 Mb. As a result, marketing performance might be higher.

𝐁𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Aim to keep battery usage under 10% per hour of gameplay on typical devices. 
As a result, game sessions will be longer and have a lower uninstall rate.

𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 Target a latency of under 200ms for online features between the US and Europe and under 75ms 
between US states on opposite coasts (e.g., California to New York). Generally, for fast-paced games, you must aim for latency below 50 milliseconds. As a result, there is less harmful feedback from players about lagging and freezes that can impact scoring in stores.

𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐍𝐑(𝐀𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐢𝐝) - 0.3% of all game sessions affected. 
Google limits: User-perceived crash rate 1.09%. User-perceived ANR rate 0.47%. 
Apple doesn't explicitly provide a specific number or threshold for crash limits in their App Store guidelines. You get higher organic installs from stores, less uninstall rate, and less harmful feedback from players about instability.

P.S
The numbers from stores are relevant for March 2024.
The context is a mobile game, match3, with 1000 or more levels, with platforms iOS/Android.
